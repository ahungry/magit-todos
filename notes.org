*** Avoid refreshing section too often

On large repos, updating the section from scratch takes some time.  It would be good to avoid doing this too often in large repos.

**** Option for when to refresh it

There should be an option for how often to refresh the to-dos section:

+  =always=
+  =manually=
+  a number of seconds (not automatically, but whenever the status buffer is refreshed and this many seconds have elapsed)

=memoize= can be used to implement this, probably with a proxy function to handle always/manually.

**** Set option automatically in large repos

The parsing/insertion should be timed, and if it takes too long, the previous option should be automatically set to timeout or manual.
